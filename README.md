# NOVA---AI

# 🤖 Nova – A Voice Assistant 

Hey!!! 
Ever watched Iron Man and wished you had your own **JARVIS**?  
Well... same here. So I built my own little version – **Nova**.

Nova is a Python-based voice assistant that listens, speaks, and responds to basic commands like opening websites, staying silent, or waking up again — all hands-free.

## Why I Built It?

I’ve always been fascinated by **Tony Stark’s JARVIS** – that futuristic AI assistant that just *gets things done*.  
So, I decided to create a basic version using Python – and that’s how **Nova** was born.
